# Choonz-Starter

'Choonz' is a Music website, designed and tested as part of the final project for SDET.

## Concept

The 'Choonz' website will allow a user to browse music, being able to look at tracks, artists, albums, genres - as well as being able to view and make playlists.

This should be scaleable from 3 to 5+ entities:

- **MUST HAVE** - Track, Artist, Album
- **SHOULD HAVE** - Genre, Playlist
- **COULD HAVE** - Login System (restrict playlist creation to logged in users)

## Specifications

The current idea as of 23-Sep-2020 is to release iterative specifications for this project, with varying degrees of functionality which the client/PO will want.

These are TBD for now, but will be included here within a `_documentation` folder in due course.
